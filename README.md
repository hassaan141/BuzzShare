# BuzzShare

**BuzzShare** is a Twitter-like social media application developed using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) with **EJS** as the templating engine. The platform allows users to register, log in, and post tweets, with a focus on secure authentication and a responsive, intuitive design.

## Project Overview

BuzzShare enables users to create accounts, authenticate securely, and share "tweets" in a social media environment. The backend was built with **Express.js** and **MongoDB** to handle and store user data, while **EJS** templates and **Tailwind CSS** provide a clean, responsive frontend.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** and **Express.js**: Backend server and API development.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user information and tweets.
- **EJS**: Templating engine for dynamic frontend content.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication.
- **bcrypt**: For password hashing and security.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive and modern styling framework for a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login using JWT for session management and bcrypt for password encryption.
- **Tweet Management**: Allows users to post, edit, and view tweets with CRUD API endpoints.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is built using EJS templates and styled with Tailwind CSS for a smooth, responsive user experience.
